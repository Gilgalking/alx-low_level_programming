A preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input in another program. Preprocessors are often used to automate repetitive tasks in software development, such as generating code for data structures, performing platform-specific optimizations, and simplifying complex expressions. The amount and kind of processing done depend on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing simple text substitutions, while others are capable of more complex operations such as conditional compilation and file inclusion.
