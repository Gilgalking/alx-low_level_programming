In C programming, a structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. Structures can be useful for organizing and managing complex data in your program.

The typedef keyword is used to create a new type definition, allowing you to define a new name for an existing data type. When used with structures, typedef can be used to create a new name for a structure, making it easier to declare variables of that type.

In summary, typedef is a keyword that is used to define new names for existing data types, and when used with structures, it can make your code more readable and easier to manage.
